        applications. It involves a combination of skills, including HTML, CSS,

        these fundamental technologies is crucial for anyone starting in the

      <p class="text2">Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures websites
        work seamlessly across a variety of devices, from desktops to
        smartphones. The key principle of responsive design is to create
        flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
        This is achieved using media queries in CSS, which allow designers to
        apply different styles depending on the device's characteristics. As
        mobile traffic continues to grow, having a responsive website is
        essential for reaching a broad audience and improving userengagement.
